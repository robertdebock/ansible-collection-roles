## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.mysql
      mysql_databases:
        - name: my_db
          encoding: utf8
          collation: utf8_bin
      mysql_users:
        - name: my_user
          password: my_pass
          priv: "my_db.*:ALL"
          update_password: on_create
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
```
