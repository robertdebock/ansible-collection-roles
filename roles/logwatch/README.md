## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.logwatch
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.roles.core_dependencies
    - role: robertdebock.roles.postfix
      postfix_relayhost: "[relay.example.com]"
      postfix_myhostname: "smtp.example.com"
      postfix_mydomain: "example.com"
      postfix_myorigin: "example.com"
      postfix_aliases:
        - name: root
          destination: test@example.com
```
