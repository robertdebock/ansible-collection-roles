## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.npm
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.roles.ca_certificates
    - role: robertdebock.roles.epel
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for npm

# The npm_registry is mapped in `vars/main.yml` to a usable default,
# you can overwrite it here if required.
npm_registry: "{{ _npm_registry[ansible_distribution] | default(_npm_registry['default'] ) }}"
```
