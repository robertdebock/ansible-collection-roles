## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.ca
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.buildtools
    - role: robertdebock.epel
    - role: robertdebock.python_pip
    - role: robertdebock.openssl
      openssl_items:
        - name: apache-httpd
          common_name: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
    - role: robertdebock.httpd
```

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for ca

# set ca_init: 'yes' to create CA
ca_init: yes

# ca_own_root: 'yes' if you want to have yout own root CA.
# if no, set ca_certificate_path manually
ca_own_root: yes

# A passphrase for the CA key.
ca_passphrase: SuP3rS3creT

# The common name for the CA.
ca_common_name: example.com

# Other details for the CA.
ca_country_name: NL
ca_email_address: robert@meinit.nl
ca_organization_name: Very little
ca_organizational_unit_name: Even less
ca_state_or_province_name: Utrecht
ca_locality_name: Utrecht

# There are two formats to request a key and certificate:
# 1. With details: (Includes `name:`)
# ca_requests:
#   - name: certificate1.example.com
#     passphrase: S3creT
#
# 2. Without details: (Does not include `name:`)
# ca_requests:
#   - "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"

# You can also mix these formats:
# ca_requests:
#   - name: certificate1.example.com
#     passphrase: S3creT
#   - "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"

# Where to publish the certificates, normally a webserver location.
# If not specified, certificates will not be published.
# {{ httpd_data_directory }} is inheritted from the role robertdebock.httpd.
ca_publication_location: "{{ httpd_data_directory | default('/tmp') }}/pub"

# Where do the certificates need to be stored? By default the distribution
# preferred locations are used (see `vars/main.yml`, under `_ca_openssl_path`.
# If you need a CA certificate somewhere else, simple use something like this:
# ca_openssl_path: /my/preferred/path
ca_openssl_path: "{{ _ca_openssl_path[ansible_os_family] | default(_ca_openssl_path['default'] ) }}"
```
