## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.ulimit
      ulimit_items:
        - limit_item: nofile
          domain: root
          limit_type: soft
          value: 1048576
        - limit_item: nproc
          domain: root
          limit_type: soft
          value: 1024
        - limit_item: nproc
          domain: root
          limit_type: hard
          value: 2048
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
```

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for ulimit

# Set the default domain. This can be overwritten per item.
ulimit_domain: '*'

# Set the limit type. This can be overwritten per item.
ulimit_limit_type: soft

# Set the file where to write to.
ulimit_dest: /etc/security/limits.conf
