## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.omsagent
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.roles.core_dependencies
    - role: robertdebock.roles.users
      users_group_list:
        - name: omiusers
      users_user_list:
        - name: omsagent
          group: omiusers
    - role: robertdebock.roles.auditd
      auditd_local_events: "no"
    - role: robertdebock.roles.cron
```
