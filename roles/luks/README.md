## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.luks
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap

  # tasks:
  #   - name: create disk0.img
  #     command: dd if=/dev/zero of=/disk0.img bs=1 count=1G
  #     args:
  #       creates: /disk0.img

  #   - name: create /dev/loop0
  #     command: mknod /dev/loop0 b 7 8
  #     args:
  #       creates: /dev/loop0
  #     notify:
  #       - link disk0.img to /dev/loop0

  # handlers:
  #   - name: link disk0.img to /dev/loop0
  #     command: losetup /dev/loop0 /disk0.img
```

luks_devices: []

# For example:
