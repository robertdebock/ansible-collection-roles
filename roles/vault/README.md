## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-vault/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.vault
      vault_show_unseal_information: yes
      vault_store_root_token: yes
      vault_make_backup: yes
      vault_kv_secrets:
        - name: my-secret
          data:
            foo: bar
            zip: zap
      # You can (optionally) set a list of nodes to join.
      vault_retry_join:
        - address: 192.168.1.1
        - address: 192.168.1.2
        - address: 192.168.1.3
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-vault/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.roles.core_dependencies
    - role: robertdebock.roles.hashicorp
```
