# defaults file for service

# service_list can contain a list of services to add to the system.
# The mandatory items for each item are:
# - name: The (short) name of the service, i.e. "tomcat".
# - description: A bit longer name, i.e. "Tomcat application server".
# - start_command: The command to start the daemon,
#   i.e. "/usr/local/bin/java -jar some.jar"
# The optional items are:
# - stop_command: By default the program that is started is found and stopped.
#   in case a running program is renamed or expanded (including a path) during
#   startup, you can specify a custom stop command here, i.e. "pkill foo"
# - status_pattern: What program (or pattern) to look for when finding the
#   status of a program, i.e. "artifactory".
# - type: How the program starts; "simple" or "forking". Simple means the
#   program runs on the foreground, i.e. "nc -l 1234". Forking means the
#   program itself forks, i.e. "nc -l 12345 &"
# - working_directory: The directory to cd into before starting the service.
# - environment_variables: A list for variables to set. for example:
#   environment_variables:
#     variable1: value1
#     variable2: value2
# - after: Start after the mentioned service.
# - restart_mode: The mode to use, for example "always".
# - restart_seconds: The time to allow restart to finish.
# - reload_command: Custom command to reload the service configuration.
#   This is useful for services that support configuration reloading
#   without a full restart, i.e. "kill -HUP $MAINPID"
