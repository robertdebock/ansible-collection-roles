## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  # This role installs packages using the `raw` module and needs to connect as
  # `root`. (`sudo` is not available before bootstrapping.) All tasks in the
  # role have `become` set to `no`, so you can use either `no` or `yes` for
  # `become`, the role will not use become (so `sudo`) for any task.
  become: yes  # `no` will also work.
  # This role installs python, gathering facts can't be done before `python` is
  # installed. This role runs the `setup` module, so facts will be available
  # after running the role.
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
```
