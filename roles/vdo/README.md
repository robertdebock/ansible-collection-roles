## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-vdo/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.vdo
      vdo_devices:
        - name: vdo1
          device: /dev/loop0
          logicalsize: 1T
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-vdo/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in [`defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-vdo/blob/master/defaults/main.yml):

```yaml
---
# defaults file for vdo

# You can make VDO devices using this list:
# vdo_devices:
#   - name: vdo1
#     device: /dev/sdz1
#     logicalsize: 1G
vdo_devices: []
```
