## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-earlyoom/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.earlyoom
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-earlyoom/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.roles.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.roles.buildtools
```
